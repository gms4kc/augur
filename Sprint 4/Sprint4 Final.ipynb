We also moved all the necessary credentials to a config.json file for greater portability, and handled errors where an email address doesn't exist in the data being used, or when there is no GitLab account and thus the api call returns an empty JSON object."

For that reason, we created a local database with the same schema, imported the data from the \"contributors\" table that already exists at augur-community-reports, and ran this code against that."

    "Next we set up a function APIcall to...you guessed it, make the api call.  The call still functions the way we showed in our prototype in sprint 2, however we've worked to avoid hardcoding anything here.  All print statements used for testing have been left in, just in case further testing is required.  They have been commented out however, as the augur sample data we have has something like 3700 tuples, and that seemed excessive to print to the console.  If there is no email address found in the contributor table somehow, we just skip that entry.  Similarly, if there exists no GitLab account for the provided email address, GitLab returns \"[]\", which provides errors when the program is expecting a full JSON object.  Our code now checks the length of the returned object and if it doesn't have a length, it just returns a null object where (id, username) would be."
