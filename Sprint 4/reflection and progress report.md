This sprint we were able to connect to the "contributors" table on the augur-community-reports to get more data instead of just using our personal emails. 

There was an issue with connecting, so we just made our own database with the same schema and imported the "contributors" table. There was also problems dealing with errors when no email was found or no GitLab ID was found, but those were worked around and now errors are dealt with properly. 

On our requirements document (in our sprint 1 submission), all of our top priorities were met and are working in the final product. The user interface was not worked not.
