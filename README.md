Group 10 Sprint 4
-----------------------------------------------

In our final sprint, we took our working prototype code and integrated it with the schema that Sean provided for us on Slack, and implemented error handling to ensure nothing trips us up as we go about matching contributor information to GitLab information.

The following information is in the documentation of our Jupyter Notebook as well, but is also addressed here for clarity's sake.

We found the databse that Goggins suggested to us, after having had some difficulty last sprint.  However, the credentials we had for the augur-community-reports databases (user chaoss) did not have permission to interact with the schema "sean", and it didn't feel right to attempt to test any student code on the other production databases.  For that reason we set up a new database locally (with the same schema via SQL provided by Sean) and copied the data out of the contributors table into our own.  

We modified the code to accept a config file instead of hardcoded values, so to test this code on your desired environment, be that your own local database or on the augur-community-reports live database, you will need to make relevant changes to the config file to access that database.

As long as you've done that, it should be as simple as running our Jupyter Notebook from beginning to end!

## What is Augur?

Augur is a software suite for collecting and measuring structured data
about [free](https://www.fsf.org/about/) and [open source](https://opensource.org/docs/osd) software (FOSS) communities.

We gather trace data for a group of repositories, normalize
it into our data model, and provide a variety of metrics about said
data. The structure of our data model enables us to synthesize data
across various platforms to provide meaningful context for meaningful
questions about the way these communities evolve.

We are a [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community>) project, and many of our
metrics are implementations of the metrics defined by our awesome community. You
can find more information about [how to get involved on the CHAOSS website](https://chaoss.community/participate/).

## Collecting Data

One of Augur's core tenets is a desire to openly gather data that people can trust, and then provide useful and well-defined metrics that help give important context to the larger stories being told by that data. We do this in a variety of ways, one of which is doing all our own data collection in house. We currently collect data from a few main sources:

1. Raw Git commit logs (commits, contributors)
2. GitHub's API (issues, pull requests, contributors, releases, repository metadata)
3. The Linux Foundation's [Core Infrastructure Initiative](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/) API (repository metadata)
4. [Succinct Code Counter](https://github.com/boyter/scc), a blazingly fast Sloc, Cloc, and Code tool that also performs COCOMO calculations

This data is collected by dedicated data collection workers controlled by Augur, each of which is responsible for some querying some subset of these data sources. We are also hard at work building workers for new data sources. If you have an idea for a new one, [please tell us](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) - we'd love your input!


## Getting Started

If you're interested in collecting data with our tool, the Augur team has worked hard to develop a detailed guide to get started with our project which can be found [in our documentation](https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/master/getting-started/toc.html).

If you're looking to contribute to Augur's code, you can find installation instructions, development guides, architecture references (coming soon), best practices and more in our [developer documentation](https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/master/development-guide/toc.html). Please know that while it's still rather sparse right now,
but we are actively adding to it all the time. If you get stuck, please feel free to [ask for help](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/issues/new)!

## Contributing

To contribute to Augur, please follow the guidelines found in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Augur is a welcoming community that is open to all, regardless if you're working on your 1000th contribution to open source or your 1st. We strongly believe that much of what makes open source so great is the incredible communitites it brings together, so we invite you to join ours!
