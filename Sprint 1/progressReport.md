For the first sprint, the group worked on creating our Requirements and Use Case documents and were able to complete this initial phase of working through our ideas. More details will be determined in the next sprint to figure out if we need to change the scope of our project.

The biggest obstacle for this sprint was just solidifying our idea, but other than that we have not experienced major challenges. We are hoping we will be able to solve the issue we laid out in our requirements/use case, otherwise, we will figure something else out with the GitLab API.
